# DistributedFountain
Second time is the charm

A project using fountain codes in a simulated distributed setting to store files. The project has two main methods:
One inside se/kth/chord/FountainCoder/FoundainEncoder.java to run only the fountain encoder/decoder
One inside se/kth/chord/simulation/ProjectMain.java to run the network with its nodes.

The nodes in the network simluates fountain encoding / decoding with timers and probability gained through the testing of
the fountain encoder/decoder.
